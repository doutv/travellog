# travellog-django
Adapted from [travellog](https://github.com/laurenhallden/travellog).

An interactive map of everywhere you've traveled, with room for image galleries, descriptions and dates. 

See example website: https://travel.huangyongjin.com/
## Motivation
The original project is hard to manage notes and photos. I plan to intergrate Django Admin for better management and smoother user experience. 

## Quick Start
Create your own travellog:
1. `git clone https://github.com/doutv/travellog-django.git`
2. `cp example.env deploy.env`
3. Fill in environment variables in `deploy.env`
4. `docker-compose up`
